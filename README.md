## ‚úÖ Conclusion ‚Äì Observed Gaps & Recommendations

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Over-Reliance on a Few Locations**  
*Finding:* Penn Station/Madison Sq West and Upper East Side North dominate pickups and drop-offs.  
*Advice:* Expand coverage and promotions to under-served neighborhoods to grow market share and reduce risk if one hub‚Äôs demand drops.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Day Trips Overwhelm Night Trips**  
*Finding:* ~70 % of bookings occur during daytime hours.  
*Advice:*  
- Introduce night-time incentives (driver bonuses, rider discounts) to balance fleet utilization.  
- Improve perceived safety and marketing for late-night travel.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Payment Method Concentration**  
*Finding:* ~67 % of payments use Uber Pay; other digital wallets and cash are much lower.  
*Advice:*  
- Encourage diverse payment options‚Äîe.g., partnerships with Google Pay/Apple Pay‚Äîto capture customers who prefer those methods.  
- Reduce cash handling costs by offering small discounts or loyalty points for digital payments.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Vehicle Mix Optimization**  
*Finding:* UberX alone contributes ~38 % of revenue and ~37 % of bookings.  
*Advice:*  
- Ensure sufficient UberX supply during peak hours.  
- Evaluate whether to scale back or re-price under-performing categories (e.g., Uber Green if margins are thin).

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Demand Forecasting & Surge Pricing**  
*Finding:* Demand is consistently high from 6 AM‚Äì8 PM, but surge pricing could be better tuned.  
*Advice:*  
- Use this historical data to train predictive models for dynamic pricing and proactive driver deployment.  
- Offer scheduled rides and driver shift planning to match predicted spikes.
